    Given a x, y pair:

    * If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
    * If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
    * If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
    * If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

    The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total
    radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and
    the inner circle a radius of 1. Of course, they are all centered at the same
    point â€” that is, the circles are concentric defined by the coordinates (0, 0).
