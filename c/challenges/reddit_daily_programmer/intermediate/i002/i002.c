/*
 * [intermediate] challenge #2
 * submitted by nottoobadguy
 *
 * Create a short text adventure that will call the user by their name. The
 * text adventure should use standard text adventure commands ("l, n, s, e, i,
 * etc.").
 *
 * For extra credit, make sure the program doesn't fault, quit, glitch, fail,
 * or loop no matter what is put in, even empty text or spaces. These will be
 * tested rigorously!  For super extra credit, code it in C.

// Going to make battleship
// Standard text adventure is a bit too big for a "daily" challenge with the
// time I have available...
