#Solutions for: C programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition.

These are in no way the best answers to the problem sets. I urge anyone who has a better method for a problem (that corresponds to what resources are available to the learner at that specific portion ot the book) to create a pull request to get it changed. I hope this repository helps newcomers as much as others have helped me.
