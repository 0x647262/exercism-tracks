### Golden Rule:

* Rule B: Don't panic

### Level 0 - Encounter:

##### Getting started:

* Rule 0.1.1.1: C is an imperitive programming language.
* Rule 0.1.2.1: C is a compiled programming language.
* Rule 0.1.2.2: A C program is portable between different platforms.
* Rule 0.1.2.3: A C program should compile cleanly without warnings.

##### The Principal Structure of a Program:

* Rule 0.2.1.1: Punctuation characters can be used with several different meanings.
* Rule 0.2.2.1: All identifiers of a program have to be declared.
* Rule 0.2.2.2: Identifiers may have several consistent declarations.
* Rule 0.2.2.3: Declarations are bound to the scope in which they appear.
* Rule 0.2.3.1: Declarations specify identifiers whereas definiations specify objects.
* Rule 0.2.3.2: An object is defined at the same time as it is initialized.
* Rule 0.2.3.3: Missing elements in initializers default to 0.
* Rule 0.2.3.4: For an array with n the first element has index 0, the last has index n - 1.
* Rule 0.2.3.5: Each object must have exactly one definition.
* Rule 0.2.4.1: Domain iterations should be coded with a for statment
* Rule 0.2.4.2: The loop variable should be defined in the initial part of a for.

### Level 1 - Acquaintance:

##### Everything is About Control:

* Rule: 1.3.1.1: The value 0 represents logical false.
* Rule: 1.3.1.2: Any value different from 0 represents logical true.
* Rule: 1.3.1.3: Don't compare to 0, false or true.
* Rule: 1.3.1.4: All scalars have a truth value.
* Rule: 1.3.3.1: case values must be integer constant expressions.
* Rule: 1.3.3.2: case labels must not jump beyond a variable definition.
