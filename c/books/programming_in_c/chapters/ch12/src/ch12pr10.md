Consider the definition of the printint macro from this chapter:

Note: This is the definition for the <code>printx()</code> macro the author
wrote earlier in the chapter, not the <code>printint()</code> macro...

        #define printint(n) printf("%i\n", x ## n)

Could the following be used to display the values of the 100 variables x1-x100?
Why or why not?

        for (i = i; i < 100; ++i)
                printx(i);

Note: I'm unsure the author meant for that <code>printx()</code> statement to 
be a </code>printint()</code> call? I can't be certain at this point because
the initial definitions for the <code>printint()</code> statement:

        /*
         * "Correct" definition of printint()
         * Per the text! (Page 310)
         */
        #define printint(var) printf("# var " = %i\n", var)

Note: I really don't understand what the heck the author was trying to do here.
I would guesss that he either wanted the working:

        x1   = 1
        x2   = 2
        x..  = ..
        x100 = 100

To print. Or he wanted it to not print and instead make a bad
<code>printf()</code> call:

        /* Let's just say i = 1 for now */
        printx(i);

        /* Expanded: printx uses printint() after bonding x ## 1 => x1 */
        printf( # var " = %i\n", var);

        /* Again: */
        printf("x1 " " = %i\n", x1);

        /* Finally: */
        printf("x1 = %i\n", x1);

        /* x1 is not a variable so the call will fail */
