What output can you expect from the following program:

        #include <stdio.h>

        int main(void)
        {
                int answer, result;

                answer = 100;
                result = answer - 10;
                printf("The result is: %i\n", result + 5);

                return 0;
        }

The expected output would be:

        $./a.out
        The result is: 95
        $
