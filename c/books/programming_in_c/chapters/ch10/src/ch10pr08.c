/*
 * Write a function called sort3() to sort three integers into ascending order.
 * (This function is not to be implemented with arrays.)
 *
 * ########## NOTES ##########
 *
 * Just going to wing it on this one. The spec is incredibly vague... Do I sort
 * all the numbers with one call? or can I call the function multiple times?
 *
 * Obviously pointers need to be passed to the function, so I _assume_ that I
 * would pass pointers to a, b, & c to the sort function? Then do a bubble sort
 * and flip them into the right order, and print with:
 *
 *      printf("%i, %i, %i\n, a, b, c);
 *
 * Or I could pass 2 pointers to the function at a time and call the function
 * until all of the numbers are in order?
 *
 *      sort3(&a, &b);
 *      sort3(&b, &c);
 *
 * Skipping: too vague.
