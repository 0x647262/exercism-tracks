What would be the output of the following program:

        int main(void)
        {
                char c,d;

                c = 'd';
                d = c;
                printf("d = %c\n", d);

                return 0;
        }

The expected output would be:

variable c stores ['d'].
d is set equal to variable c.
d now stores ['d'].
print variable d.

        $./a.out
        d
        $
