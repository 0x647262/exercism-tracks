Why could you have replaced the while statement of the equalStrings() function
of program 9.4 with the statement

	while ( s1[i] == s2[i] && s1[i] != '\0' )

to achieve the same results?

Answer:

Because as soon as <code>s1[i]</code> and <code>s2[i]</code> are unequal, the
loop would break. If <code>s2[]</code> was smaller, it would reach the
<code>'\0'</code> before <code>s1['\0']</code> was reached.
